<!-- Text Border, Margin & Padding
Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:

border-
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specifies to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.

	Border Style
You can control the style of a border using the border-style property. This property can take the following values:
 · solid, a single solid line
 · dotted, a series of square dots (if your border is 2px wide, then the dots are 2px squared with a 2px gap between each dot)
 · dashed, a series of short lines
 · dashed, a series of short lines
 · double, two solid lines (the value of the border-width property creates the sum of the two lines)
 · groove appears to be carved into the page
 · ridge appears to stick out from the page
 · inset appears embedded into the page
 · outset looks like it is coming out of the screen
 · hidden / none no border is shown
border values can be written in one line: border style, border size, and border color: border: dashed 5px red				-->
