   <p>My favorite tea Pu-erh tea, but, chrysanthemum tea and melissa with mint is good too. It's distinct taste happens to go well with mint and small amounts of black tea leaves. Best tea I've ever had. Tea has all sorts of benefits, and can even balance mood. It's a nice flower, I've had it in tea and found bakers using using it with cakes.</p><p> Melissa is a genus of perennial herbs in the family Lamiaceae. Its species are native to Europe and Asia but cultivated and naturalized in many other places. The name Melissa is derived from the Greek word μέλισσα meaning "honeybee", owing to the abundance of nectar in the flowers. The stems are square, like most other plants in the mint family." - Wikipedia</p><p><a class="source_links" href="https://balticsupermart.com/products/hyleys-melissa-and-mint-45g-packaged-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tea<p></p></p><section class="source_links"><a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lab 4 Home</a></section>
