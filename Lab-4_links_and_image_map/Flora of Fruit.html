	<p>Nature is great. I would like to study botany and spend hours jotting down information on plants and flowers. Research and database management is nicely combined. The internet was created by programmers for scientists after all!.</p><p>Malus ioensis, known as the Iowa crab or prairie crabapple, is a species of crabapple tree native to the United States. The most common variety, M. ioensis var. ioensis, is found primarily in the prairie regions of the upper Mississippi Valley. Another variety, M. ioensis var. texana, or the Texas crabapple, is found only in a small region of central Texas.[3]

The Iowa crab can grow up to 10 meters (35 feet) in height. It bears white or pink flowers in the summer and small apple-like berries in the fall.[4]

Various wildlife consume the fruit.[5] - Wikipedia</p><a class="source_links" href="https://www.tropicos.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very neat database</a><p></p><section class="source_links"><a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lab 4 Home</a></section>
