   <p>Traveling to at great lengths has it's rewards. Some destinations are untouched and unhindered by the rigourous progression of modern society. These are my favorite places on earth⸺  traveling by rail is one way of reaching these beautiful locales.
   Railways in general are very interesting marvels of engineering as grand in scale as that of a skyline. Automotive vehicles evolved personal transportation, but, one can perceive the railway as the first modern implementation of a distributed network of locations all joined together in an architectural design much like the first internetworks of the internet⸺  pre Internet. Amtrack for instance would have acted as an ISPs manufacturing tracks for interconnection, and as network engineers programming packets to work with the newly raised stations that can accept both packet switched interface technology and circuit switched equipped freight cars. Technology is awesome but science nourishes the ideas. I really like nature.</p>

	   <p>I travelled to southern New Jersey to pick up a PC I found on craigslist. The journey was last minute, slightly nostalgic, and way too expensive. Going there I found that one could pick from a variety of rides, granted you missed your ride and did not realize that some train stations pretty much operated with trains arriving within a moments notice and leaving just as quickly. I rode in a nice amtrack train car in my departure, due South. Coming back.. I detoured, and took a very old railway car coming back. The trip was awesome, the PC is very nice and in particular is my school PC. It was my first time traveling by rail, and I realized I had not left the state in way too long.
