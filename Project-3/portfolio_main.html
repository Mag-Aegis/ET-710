        <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">Sample Blog Post</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">1 January 2021 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>
        <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that are supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic text, images, and code are fully supported.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Ensuring food security in the future is a concern for governments and scientists alike. During the twentieth century, the world's population quadrupled, and estimates suggest it will reach ten billion people by 2050. This huge increase will pose a major challenge and increasing pressure on agricultural production capacity. This has led to the development of innovative techniques for food production beyond agriculture, including a futuristic technique that produces food from air.</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>Agriculture occupies large areas of land and consumes huge amounts of water, and food production through agriculture contributes a high percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Agriculture occupies large areas of land and consumes huge amounts of water. Food production through agriculture contributes a high percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, and for comparison, this percentage is greater than that produced by the transport sector with all its cars, trucks, planes, and trains.</p>
        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>Plants obtain their food through a process called photosynthesis, where plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere into food and release oxygen as a byproduct of this chemical reaction. This process occurs in the "chloroplasts." Plants use the energy of sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and other chemical reactions produce glucose, which they use as a food source, and oxygen is released into the atmosphere. This means that plants convert carbon dioxide into food through complex chemical reactions. Photosynthesis is one of the most important chemical reactions on Earth, as it helped in the past to develop our planet and bring life to it. Plants use carbon dioxide to make their food and release oxygen to help other organisms breathe!</p>
        <h3>Subtitle</h3>
        <p>This process inspired NASA scientists in the 1960s to explore the idea of feeding astronauts on long space missions, such as traveling to Mars. One promising idea was to produce food from the carbon dioxide exhaled by astronauts, not by plants but by small single-celled microbes capable of harvesting carbon dioxide to produce large amounts of nutritious protein in the form of a tasteless powder, which can be used to make familiar foods.</p>
        <pre><code>Example code block</code></pre>
        <p>Unlike the plant world, these microbes do not use light as in photosynthesis, but can grow in the dark. These bacteria are called "hydrogenotrophs," and they use hydrogen as fuel to produce food from carbon dioxide. When astronauts produce carbon dioxide, the microbes capture it and, with other inputs, turn it into carbon-rich food. In this way, we get a closed carbon cycle.</p>
        <h3>Subtitle</h3>
        <p>More than half a century after NASA's research, several companies in the synthetic biology sector, including Air Protein and Solar Foods, are developing a new generation of sustainable food products with no carbon footprint. These food products will not be limited to astronauts but will extend to all people on Earth and will be produced in a short period, instead of months, and without relying on agricultural land. This means obtaining food products very quickly. It will also be possible to produce food vertically through these microbes, instead of the traditional horizontal method similar to modern vertical farming technology. This means producing more food from the same area.</p>
        <p>Human food consists of three main types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proteins</li>
          <li>Carbohydrates</li>
          <li>Fats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Proteins are made up of amino acids, a group of organic compounds, of which there are twenty in the human body, including nine essential ones obtained from food. Amino acids are mainly composed of:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Carbon</li>
          <li>Hydrogen</li>
          <li>Oxygen</li>
          <li>Nitrogen</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Nitrogen makes up 78% of the air, and hydrogen is obtained by electrolysis of water, and it is theoretically possible to extract carbon from the air to form these acids, as carbon is the backbone of amino acids, and life on Earth is based on carbon because of its ability to form long carbon chains, which is what microbes do by making amino acids from carbon dioxide through a set of complex chemical reactions. In addition to making protein-rich meals, these microbes produce other products such as oils that have many uses.</p>

        <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">Another Blog Post</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">23 December 2020 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>
        <p>Currently, several companies are studying these microbes more deeply and cultivating them to obtain food. In 2019, researchers at the American company Air Protein announced their success in converting carbon dioxide in the air into artificial meat made from protein, which does not require any agricultural land and is mainly dependent on air.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Meat has been produced in many varieties</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>These researchers used air and renewable energy as inputs in a fermentation-like process to produce protein containing the nine essential amino acids and rich in vitamins and minerals, and it is free of hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, and herbicides.</p>
        <p>Meat has been produced in many varieties, including poultry, beef, and seafood, without carbon emissions, unlike raising cattle, which contributes to the emission of methane, a greenhouse gas.</p>

        <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">New Feature</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">14 December 2020 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>
        <p>The Finnish company Solar Foods has developed a technique to produce protein from air, starting by splitting water into its components, hydrogen and oxygen, using electricity. Hydrogen provides energy for bacteria to convert carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the air into organic matter rich in protein more efficiently than plants using photosynthesis. This protein resembles wheat flour and has been named "Solein".</p>
        <p>The company is currently collecting data on the food product to submit to the European Union for food licensing, and it plans to start commercial production next year, 2021. The company has stated that it is interested in producing environmentally friendly foods using basic materials: electricity and carbon dioxide, and these foods will avoid the negative environmental impact of traditional agriculture, which includes everything from land and water use
